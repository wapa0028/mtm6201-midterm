        <h3>Drew McDougall</h3>
        <h7>Owner</h7>
        <p>It started as a fun hobby. She wanted to get more involved with her culture and
            she picked up beading. Drew set herself a milestone, make herself a jingle dress
            for the next powwow. So, set out on her mission succeeded all while still making
            earrings in her free time. This lead to her selling at the powwow and then later
            getting her very own table. Eventually this all culminated to her starting her
            Instagram where she promotes and sells her earrings and beaded jewelery. This
            made her create her own etsy shop to keep track of orders better. Now she's made
            this sight to further market her amazing earrings.</p>
